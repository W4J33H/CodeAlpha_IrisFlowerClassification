# Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

This project implements a **machine learning model** to classify iris flowers into one of three species â€” *Iris-setosa*, *Iris-versicolor*, or *Iris-virginica* â€” based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Uses the famous **Iris Dataset** from scikit-learn.
- Trains a classification model with high accuracy.
- Includes data visualization for feature understanding.
- Outputs model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
