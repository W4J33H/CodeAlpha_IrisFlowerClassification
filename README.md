# Code Alpha Tasks

Task 1 
# CodeAlpha_IrisFlowerClassification
# Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

This project implements a **machine learning model** to classify iris flowers into one of three species â€” *Iris-setosa*, *Iris-versicolor*, or *Iris-virginica* â€” based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Uses the famous **Iris Dataset** from scikit-learn.
- Trains a classification model with high accuracy.
- Includes data visualization for feature understanding.
- Outputs model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

- Task 2
#- CodeAlpha_CarPricePrediction
#ðŸš— Car Price Prediction

This project implements a machine learning regression model to predict car prices based on features such as brand goodwill, horsepower, mileage, engine size, and year of manufacture.

#ðŸ“Œ Features
Performs data preprocessing and feature engineering for clean inputs.
Trains a regression model (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to estimate prices.
Evaluates performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
Includes visualizations with Matplotlib for better feature understanding.
Demonstrates real-world applications of machine learning in price prediction.
